Welcome aboard! I've been working on this blog for some time and I'm finally glad to see it live! I'm Zyad, but I also go by Zee. I'm born and raised back-end but also have some experience with front-end. Most of my experience is in C#, with work experience also in Java.
I've worked in multiple industries varying from small, medium, and large corporations. So why have I created a blog? I'm at a stage in my early career (I've been working for a few years) where I've seen enough "huh?" and "wow" moments that I've reflected heavily on.

Let's go back to my university days. I went to school for Business Administration & Computer Science and was the only student to graduate in this double major (with internship) program, proof below.

I always knew I wanted to be a Software Developer growing up. I enjoyed coding and became very fascinated by computers at a very early age. In my under-graduate studies, I questioned my degree multiple times. After my first year, I was thinking about dropping business entirely and specializing in Software Engineering. That didn't last long after I looked at the classes I had to take to make the switch. Shortly after that, almost close to my 2nd year, I was debating in majoring in Accounting & Computer Science. I took two accounting classes in high school and really enjoyed the financials behind the work. After I spoke to a counselor, I realized that I couldn't become both. Course work would be very tough and I'd have almost no elective courses (courses that I could pick on my own, not that I had many electives in my double major anyways). In my 3rd year I started to intern at much bigger corporations and realized that I was good at what I was doing, so I kept on my path.

My happiest moment in my life must have been the first time Microsoft reached out to me for an interview for a post graduate job in Seattle. I was 20 years old at the time and would have graduated 14 months after the interview process. Looking back I'm surprised they were hiring 14 months in advance, is this the norm? I didn't end up moving forward in that interview. One year later to the day, Microsoft contacted me again for another opportunity in Seattle. I thought the interview went well, but I was not moved forward for that either. We can get into the details of these interviews in another post. After I graduated, I moved to Ottawa, Canada for a job that I'm still very thankful for. I joined a group of very talented developers of whom I learned many things from. Following this job, I moved back closer to home for another opportunity in Detroit, US.

I've worked as a main developer on multiple projects and as part of a team on other multiple projects. I found my interests in dev early in my career. While working in Ottawa, I worked on systems that were designed very well from top to bottom by some of the smartest people I've ever had the pleasure to work with. It led me to start reading books about .Net Core and design patterns. I started implementing them in my own personal projects.

I'm currently reading "Professional C# 7.0 and .NET Core 2.0" by Christian Nagel & also "The Clean Coder" by Robert C. Martin. I'm really enjoying the latter, although I don't agree with all the points, but it allows me to mentally argue with some points until I realize I'm probably wrong.
C# 8.0 and .Net Core 3.0 have recently been announced, so I have to step up my book game. That's alright, one step at a time.

Anyways, I've already rambled for far too long - this was not meant to be a cliche "first post", although it definitely turned out that way. You be the judge of that!

> Stay tuned, the next post will be, you guessed it, about a design pattern.
